A Project Coordinator, for the Gemius AdReal study. My goal is the optimal use of resources as well as the analysis and implementation of new solutions that meet customer needs. My high attention to detail and the ability to solve problems with a "can do" attitude helped me a lot during my career and I wish to continue putting those skills to good use.
